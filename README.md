# Responsive Layout

This repo is going to be used for practicing different methods of implementing a responsive, mobile layout for a React app.

Base responsiveness has been implemented via TailwindCSS

Integrated the app with a recipe API from API Ninja. Next to implement will be a modal to display recipe data from API Ninja. (Modal implemented, need to finish styling it)

Will also be implementing a database for persistent storage. Still unsure if I'm going to use a relationship database like PSQL. May look into MongoDB just for extra experience.
